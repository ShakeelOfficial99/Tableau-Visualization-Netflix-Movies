# Objective: 

In this project, you will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Tableau, which is a crucial step before any AI or machine learning task. EDA helps you understand the underlying patterns, distributions, and relationships within your data, setting the stage for more sophisticated analysis. By engaging deeply with the data through Tableau, you will practice making informed decisions that not only improve the effectiveness of your visualizations but also lay a solid groundwork for future predictive modeling or machine learning applications. You will select a substantial dataset of your choice and develop an interactive dashboard that uncovers and presents meaningful insights. 

The dataset should include around 1,000 items (rows) and 10 attributes (columns). Your final submission will include a Tableau Public link to your dashboard and a concise report detailing your EDA process, design decisions, and any challenges encountered.

# Dataset Selection

# Choose a dataset that interests you and is relevant to your field of study or work.
# The dataset must have at least 1,000 items (row) and 8 variables (columns), offering a rich context for exploration.
# Possible sources include Kaggle, Data.gov, and other open data platforms.
# Ensure that the dataset is clean or perform the necessary preprocessing before uploading it to Tableau.

# Interactive Dashboard

# Visualization Design:

# Your task is to create a series of visualizations (at least 4) that effectively communicate key insights from your dataset.
# Use various chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, box plot) that are best suited for the data based on the theory discussed in the class.
# The goal is to explore the data comprehensively, revealing patterns, trends, and anomalies.
# Interactivity and User Experience:
# Enhance the EDA process by incorporating interactive elements such as filters, parameters, and tooltips.
# This interactivity allows users to dynamically explore different aspects of the data, deepening their understanding.
# Creativity and Innovation:
# Leverage advanced Tableau features such as calculated fields, level of detail (LOD) expressions, or story points to enrich your EDA.
# Think creatively about how to visualize the data to discover hidden insights and tell a compelling data story.
